    Hey I'm Ethan, front-end developer in San Francisco. I've been programming for the past 5 years, the last 3 years focused on modern web development and design, overseeing the launch of two websites and numerous apps. I love learning how things work, looking at things in new ways, and making meaningful improvements to processes & products.
    `,
  p2: `
    My current position relies heavily on using my business knowledge to improve things via technology. From a technical standpoint, I spend most of my time working with Javascript, CSS3, HTML5 (and VBA). My personal projects have allowed me to try & participate in the new web technologies, and am looking to utilize and continue improving these skills.
